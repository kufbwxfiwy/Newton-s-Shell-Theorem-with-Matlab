# Newton-s-Shell-Theorem-with-Matlab
## This is a numerical proof of Newton's Shell Theorem
An approach was taken where a holow sphere was created from point masses and a singular point mass was approached to this sphere. The resulting force on this mass was then plotted against the distance from the sphere.

A vectorial approach was taken throughout. So each point has three force components ascribed to it. Obviously Matlab is ideal for these kind of calculations.

### The following two figures illustrates how the sphere is made up:

### This is an isometric view of the approach:

### This is the plot of the approach:

### And this is an animated GIF showing a rotation of the sphere and point:
