# Newton-s-Shell-Theorem-with-Matlab
## This is a numerical proof of Newton's Shell Theorem
An approach was taken where a holow sphere was created from point masses and a singular point mass was approached to this sphere. The resulting force on this mass was then plotted against the distance from the sphere.

A vectorial approach was taken throughout. So each point has three force components ascribed to it. Obviously Matlab is ideal for these kind of calculations.

The following figure illustrates how the sphere is made up:
