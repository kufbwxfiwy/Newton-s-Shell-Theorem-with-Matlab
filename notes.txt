This is the same project but automated so as to produce and plot a vector of the forces which the small gravitational point experiences along various positions of the x-axis.
10 September 2011

I used a gravitational equation of (6.7*85*20)/(dist^2), i.e. G=6.7, m1=85, m2=20 throught this work.

Run creates2 (or creates4), dstances, calcforc in that order to compute the force from the globe.

Or run doall, close figure 2 and type in rotate.
